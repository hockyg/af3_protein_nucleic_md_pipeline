This repository has code and data for computing interaction energies between protein and nucleic acids starting from sequence, 
using AlphaFold3 and MD simulations in OpenMM.

Interaction pairs were taken from the ProNAB database and used with permission. People interested in
using that data should contact the authors of that database for permission [https://web.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo2/pronab/].
